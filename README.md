# END-TO-END-PREDICTING-DIABETES-MACHINE-LEARNING
Developed and deployed a diabetes prediction pipeline using Python and Colab
Notebook, utilizing Pandas for preprocessing and Scikit-learn for model training. Improved accuracy by 1%
through systematic refinement.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Boosted Random Forest model accuracy from 94% to 95% by evaluating over
200 hyperparameter configurations with GridSearchCV and ShuffleSplit, leading to a 1% performance gain.
Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization: Cleansed and preprocessed 2,000+ records using Pandas,
engineered and evaluated multiple models with Scikit-learn, and generated detailed visualizations with
Matplotlib and Seaborn, achieving a 98% accuracy rate.
